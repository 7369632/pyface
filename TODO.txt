* Remove the dependency on enthought.developer AND enthought.io by refactoring
    dock features modules.

* Determine if we should relocate or refactor the new_dialog module which adds
    dependencies on enthought.naming.  There is also a enthought.naming
    dependency in dock/dock_window.py due to handling drag'n'drop.
